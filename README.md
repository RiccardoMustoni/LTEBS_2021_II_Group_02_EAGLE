# LTEBS_2021_II_Group_02_EAGLE


### Final Version 
The aim of the project is to design a PCB embedding the PSoC 5LP micro-controller in order to evaluate its performance and to determine if such uC is suitable for the project. The PCB embeds the CY8CKIT-059 kit, which will be soldered on male jumpers, and other additional components required to coduct the proper testing. 

The project consists in the design of a schematic, a board, and a library containing the necessary components. Design rules are added according to the technical specifications reported in the manufacturer website MDSrl.


### Project Folder 
The folder contains the schematic ("Group_02.sch") and the board ("Group_02.brd") used to create the final PCB.

### Library Folder 
The folder contains the library ("Group_02_Library.lbr") for the components TCA9546A and TMUX1208 with footprints, symbols and devices. 

### Design Rules Folder 
The folder contains the design rules ("Group_02.dru") according to the technical info on the manufacturer website.
